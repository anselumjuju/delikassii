# Delikassii üçΩÔ∏è

Delikassii is a recipe web application built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. It allows users to search for recipes, view detailed information about each recipe, and explore a variety of culinary ideas. The app leverages **unstable caching** from Next.js to cache API data efficiently, reducing the number of API calls and speeding up the app's performance.

The recipe data is sourced from the **Tasty API** (via RapidAPI), offering rich recipe information like ingredients, instructions, nutrition, user ratings, and more.

## Features

- üîç **Recipe Search**: Find recipes based on a search query.
- ü•ò **Detailed Recipe View**: See recipe details including ingredients, instructions, nutritional info, and ratings.
- ‚ö° **Unstable Cache**: Uses Next.js unstable cache to store API results, improving performance.
- üé® **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS to ensure a sleek and responsive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building fast, server-side rendered applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for designing the user interface.
- **Tasty API**: A recipe API from RapidAPI to fetch recipe data.
